## Prerequisites
Before you get started, you’re going to need a few things:<br>

### Your favorite IDE or text editor<br>
### Python 3.6 or later<br>
### PIP<br>
Streamlit — This one’s kind of important, so don’t forget to install.<br>
If you haven’t already, take a few minutes to read through Main concepts to understand Streamlit’s data flow model.<br>

### Set up your virtual environment
<br>
Regardless of which package management tool you’re using, we recommend running these commands in a virtual environment. This ensures that the dependencies pulled in for Streamlit don’t impact any other Python projects you’re working on.<br>

## pipenv
## venv
## virtualenv
## conda
## Install Streamlit
### $ pip install streamlit
<code>
 import streamlit as st<br>
 import numpy as np<br>
import pandas as pd<br>
</code>
##### Run your app. A new tab will open in your default browser. It’ll be blank for now. That’s OK.

##### $ streamlit run first_app.py
